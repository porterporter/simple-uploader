# stric-image-host

issue: when uploading an image, logging file.type returns the correct filetype
when serving the image, logging file.type only shows application/octet-stream
how do i save the mime type when saving the image to disk?

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
